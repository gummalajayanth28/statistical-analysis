# Statistical Analysis in Python

This repository provides an introduction to statistical analysis using Python, focusing on both descriptive and inferential statistics. Key libraries include pandas, numpy, scipy, and statsmodels. The repository uses datasets such as the Diabetes dataset from sklearn and encourages exploration of datasets from Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Sections:

### 1. Basic Concepts in Statistics
- *Population & Sample*: Understand the difference between populations and samples and the importance of sampling in statistics.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- *Measures*: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range, skewness, and kurtosis.
- *Insights*: Summarize and describe datasets' central tendencies, variability, and distribution shapes.

### 3. Inferential Statistics
- *Techniques*: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.
- *Goal*: Draw conclusions and make predictions about a population based on a sample.

### 4. Python Setup
- Install the required libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels.

### 5. Sample Code
- Load the Diabetes dataset and compute descriptive statistics.
- Perform inferential analysis, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

### 6. Exercises
- *Exercise 1*: Analyze a health-related dataset from Kaggle or UCI, calculate key statistics, and conduct hypothesis testing.
- *Exercise 2*: Apply regression analysis to explore relationships between variables.

## Conclusion
This repository helps you get started with statistical analysis in Python, empowering you to uncover patterns, draw insights, and make data-driven decisions based on real-world datasets.
